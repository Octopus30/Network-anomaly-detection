    "## Problem Statement\n",
    " In the realm of cybersecurity, **network anomaly detection** is a critical task that involves identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from the norm within network traffic. These anomalies could signify a range of security threats, from compromised devices and malware infections to large-scale cyber-attacks like **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge lies in accurately detecting these anomalies in real-time, amidst the vast and continuous streams of network data, which are often **noisy and heterogeneous**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods of network anomaly detection often rely on predefined rules or signatures based on known attack patterns. However, these methods fall short in detecting **new or evolving threats** that do not match the existing signatures. Furthermore, as network environments grow in complexity, maintaining and updating these rules becomes increasingly **cumbersome and less effective**.\n"
